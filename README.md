### Subway Fare Evasion Arrests Analysis

I've web-scraped publicly available NYPD data and developed a visual breakdown of Subway Fare Evasion-related arrests in 2023, utilizing interactive visualization tools to delve into the data more effectively. You can explore the website-based dashboard I created using Python, Dash, and Plotly here: https://subway-fare-evasion-app.onrender.com).
Data Source: https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/subway-fare-evasion.page 
This dashboard allows for dynamic exploration of the data through interactive charts. Additionally, I have attached a detailed Jupyter Notebook named "Hrithik_Shukla_Subway_Fare_Evasion_Analysis.ipynb," outlining the methodology, data sources, and code used for this analysis.
